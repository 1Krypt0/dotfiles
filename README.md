# Archppuccin

Hey there! This is my personal collection of dotfiles, which make the system look and feel amazing!

There will also be an installation script here when I have the chance to do one.

Here are some of the main points of the setup:

- OS: Arch, btw
- WM: bspwm
- Bar: [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
- Shell: [zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zsh) with the [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs/)
- Terminal: [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- Editor: [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for must stuff but also [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)
- PKM: [LogSeq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq), an amazing tool I have found recently
- Launcher: [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/)
- Browser: Firefox with custom [Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento) theme
- Theme: [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/)

But there is lot more stuff! All of these dotfiles are managed with the help of [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

This will probably expand over time as I find more stuff to add here, but for now enjoy!

## Obligatory Screenshots

## Setting up (TODO)
